This example shows how to extract linux metrics using node_exporter. A node_exporter container is booted up pointing to the host systems /proc and /sys folders using docker mounts. The node exporter is ready to be scraped on port 9100.

Prometheus is configured to scrape node_exporter:9100 address. Open up http://localhost:9090 and look for metrics prefixed with node_. There are a lot of metrics ready to be explored.
